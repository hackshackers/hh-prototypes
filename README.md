# Hacks/Hackers prototypes

This repository contains in-browser protoypes, wireframes and other assets for the redesign project that [Alley Interactive](http://www.alleyinteractive.com/) is working on.

The `master` branch is published to https://hackshackers.github.io/hh-prototypes/.

You can see a listing of available prototype for review at:

## Development

`$ cd prototype/ && npm start`

Webpack watches `prototype/client` and `prototype/src` for changes, and regenerates the files in `prototype/dist` accordingly.

To view the generated static pages in your browser, open a file system URL like:

```
file:///Users/yourname/projects/hh-prototypes/prototype/dist/homepage.html
```

Then reload the page as you make changes.
